## Why do we teach?

::: Notes

* You meet many **interesting people**.
* It has a **multiplying** effect, and **no downsides**.
* Generates karma and **gives back to society** part of what we learn.
* It helps you **structure your thoughts** and delve into subjects you are passionate about.
* It's the only true way **to prove that you know** something.
* It helps to build your **personal brand**.
* It boosts our **egos**.

::: Notes

**We put passion** in our job, so we **expect to have a disciplined crowd**
anxious for learning from us, we imagine them to be as excited as we are
regarding all the topics that we explain, with a **perfectly organized**
schedule that allows each one to attend to all sessions, to build
an experience based on sharing knowledge.

::: Notes

Reality is, live happens. Most **students will struggle to find time** for
attending the classes, and many of them **will already exhausted** when they
join our training. And each story will be different, making it very difficult
to find a way to customize the class time to their needs.

By te way, you can **find me in the middle of the photo**. It was taken during
my time at the University.

::: Notes

**Teaching has always been challenging**. But now, very often, we do it **remotely**.
This has an incredible potential for **democratizing access to knowledge**, but also
adds **new challenges** by the fact that we share the space **through a little window**
called our computers.

::: Notes

We don't expect children to be able to paint photorealistic portraits, but sometimes we treat adults as if everyone was **already an expert** in the subject of the training. We act as if they are in our course to become the most proficient person in the world.

So take it easy. **Simplify** everything. **Limit the scope**. And point them to **additional resources** if you consider they can take advantage of them.

Kill your ego. Remove that part of the explanation that is not so important. Although I must confess that I'm not always able to do it.

* Students, not us, are the **stars of the show**.
* They **will not remember** it all.
* They **don't need to become experts** right now.
* All the **knowledge is already in the web**, for free.
* Synchronous training is **like attending to the gym**, a social ritual.
* It is a **more effective** way of learning.
* We love **hearing stories**
* We want to be **part of a great experience**.

::: Notes

This watch has been created by **[FreakishClock](https://www.sabrinafossi.com/)**, an Italian design firm based in Florence. Notice how even a concept as extraordinarily familiar as **a clock can be stylized** down to its essence **without losing effectiveness**. It eliminates the superfluous, increases the signal-to-noise ratio. You will be **understood** more easily, they will **remember** it better, and you will explain it in **less time**.

**Garr Reynolds** put this in relation with the asian **Zen** tradition.

Kill your ego. Delete what doesn't matter. Ask yourself, **and what?** on each slide. **Focus on core ideas**, remove the rest. Leave them as **additional resources**.

And, among everything else, keep your **explanations short**.

## Become a storyteller

![Exploration And Mountain Climbing, by Karolina, https://www.pexels.com/photo/exploration-and-mountain-climbing-3669288/](https://images.pexels.com/photos/3669288/pexels-photo-3669288.jpeg)

::: Notes

We start learning about our reality through **stories told by our parents**, so it is easy to understand why this **symbolic** mechanism is so **deeply integrated** in the way we understand new concepts. A good story will **provide context**, explaining why the current topic **matters to a particular person** or group. That is what we call **The Mission**. And it will also set a path for the **Hero's journey** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey) for saving the day.

In other words, **don't focus on the tools** as a goal by themselves. Instead, propose to use them for **solving a problem**. That will provide meaning to the effort, changing the **motivation of the students** towards learning.

And, please, use **emotions**. Passion and emotions are the **main drivers** of many learners.

**Joseph Campbell** wrote [a whole book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces) about it. But you don't need to read it, as it is surprisingly boring ;)

## Fear

![Selective Photo of Gray Shark, by George Desipris, https://www.pexels.com/photo/selective-photo-of-gray-shark-726478/](https://images.pexels.com/photos/726478/pexels-photo-726478.jpeg)

::: Notes

This is the most basic question a brain will make: **can it eat me?**

Fear is an useful emotion: it help us to **prevent unpleasant results**. For example, there is no need to be a good communicator while speaking at a **military briefing**: all attendants understand that it is their **life what it is as stake**.

There are many spaces in which it is healthy to introduce a sense of fear: **cybersecurity**, **cost management**, etc. Use it wisely for enhancing engaging as it **can loose effectiveness if abused**.

::: Notes

The second question your brain will make is, usually **can I eat it?**.

Well, maybe not literally. But explaining how achieving a goal may help **progressing at work**, increase the student **income** or reduce the amount of time required to do a task (and thus, increasing his/her **quality of life**) may be considered in this category.

For example, while the demand for classic system administrators is declining, **cloud engineers are still highly valued** in the job market.

By the way, never display food photos around lunchtime ;).

Ok, not about food chains anymore. But, **may we have sex?**. In a broader sense, is it going to be **exciting**? We love technology, we enjoy being able to push if further to a different level. **Learning is sexy**!

::: Notes

Ok, maybe we are not Chris Hemsworth. But remember: the freaking **Miles Davis** himself said "I think the greatest sound in the world is the human voice.", and you are lucky enough to have one. So put it in good use, as any medieval bard knew using the **proper tone and modulation** is enough to boost imagination and **engage** with the audience.

It is the most basic **mechanism we have to communicate** with each other, an incredibly versatile tool for **connecting**. At the same time, there is nothing more **depressing** that attending to a long talk given by someone who doesn't know how to **express emotions** through his or her voice.

And, please, use a **good microphone**.

## Make great slides

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813snnhmkKL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg)

::: Notes

If you don't have time for anything else, read **Garr Reynolds** blog [Presentation Zen](https://www.presentationzen.com/), or event better, find his book in your local library.

And remember, we are **visual creatures**. Don't abuse text: your slides are **not documentation**, write a freaking document to provide additional content or simply use the **speakers notes to go deeper**. But before putting so many details in the notes, be sure you list the **keywords that will trigger the different sections** of your explanation at the top of them

The **worst sin** you can do in the classroom is to **limit yourself to reading** the slides. Why are you there, if all the content is already displayed behind you? Also, we read faster than you speak: **nobody is going to care** at all about what you are saying if they are busy reading your slide.

Good slides will **guide YOU**, and **complement** your explanation. They will provide **ascetics** to your history, and will **anchor your students** again in the explanation if they **lost focus** for a moment.

Try to make good use of the typography: a **good font face will add personality**, but will be easy to read and non distracting.

And, again, **never read your freaking slides**.

::: Notes

But, you know what? Maybe **you don't need slides**.

Developing the **supporting visuals** at the same time that we are explaining a topic can be a very effective way of providing **increasing levels of detail**, reducing the [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) of the students. Also, it helps a lot for keeping their **focused** on the explanation, thanks to the **visual dynamic** nature of it.

::: Notes

Do **demos**. Lots of them. Each time you can show how to do something **instead of explaining** it, go for the demo. It can go wrong, for sure, but that's not a problem in the long term (see **[Bill Gates during Win98 presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeUyxjLhAxU)**). For extra engagement, make the **pupils follow your instructions** on their own environment. And encourage them to break things.

If it is really important, **record the demo** as a plan B: I've seen presenters in conferences delivering a "live" demo with Windows 10 supposedly running in a Mac ;).

Laziness is a way of **preserving energy**. We fall in that state easily, with good reasons. That is way we sign up for a **gym**, or why we organize **study groups**. Also, we are **social**: we enjoy doing things together, like **lecture clubs**. Transform your class in a **social event**.

Put people to work. **Active work**. And make it **fun**.

::: Notes

Create **heterogeneous groups** that complement each other. Organize the labs and **practices around them**, in such a way that throughout the course a work dynamic is created that **makes them accountable** to each other and allows them to **help each other**.

As a side effect, you'll have **less work**: instead of interacting with each individual, you'll be able to do so with only four, five, or six entities.

In remote, tools like **[Gather Town](https://gather.town)** will make a difference as traditional conferencing software is not designed at all for **active learning**.

::: Notes

Provide the groups with self service **lab environments** if possible. Give them automated ways of **testing** what they are learning. Provide them with instructions for completing tasks, making labs a way to better understand what's happening.

**Cloud** resources are awesome for creating **ephemeral scenarios**. Local **VMs** are another great resource, although they are more intrusive as they required to be installed in the participants computers.

## Turn all upside down

![A World Map Paper Cutting on a Chopping Board, by Monstera Production, https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-world-map-paper-cutting-on-a-chopping-board-7411946/](https://images.pexels.com/photos/7411946/pexels-photo-7411946.jpeg)

::: Notes

**[Flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)** is a strategy that suggests providing **lectures in advance** to students, for instance, by recording previously discussed whiteboard sessions. Subsequently, **synchronous time is invested in activities**: discussions, problem-solving, etc. In essence, students complete traditional homework in class and attend master classes at home.

One crucial aspect to note is that while video is commonly used in this model, it is entirely possible to provide **other formats** (such as quizzes, short texts, podcast listening, etc). The primary objective is to transform classroom time into a 100% active experience for the attendees by using it to discuss notes, create concept maps, solve problems, write texts, design solutions, or implement labs. At the end, their learning is evaluated by checking their progress or through a dedicated test.

There are some [metastudies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095771817300993) and [cases](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/18/us/my-view-flipped-classrooms-give-every-student-a-chance-to-succeed/index.html) indicating that this can be an **effective way of improving student scores**, although it significantly depends on the instructor's attitude towards technology and content creation.

Fortunately for us, we all know how to use a computer! More importantly, this approach may help us combat our worst enemy: the final session hour. By shifting part of the content to an asynchronous format, we can **reduce the duration of the live sessions** and assist students in maintaining focus throughout.

Moreover, it's entirely feasible to reuse the videos as long as they remain relevant, which ultimately will **increase the productivity** of the instructor's work. Or simply provide a curated list of content if it is good enough to fulfill the purpose of the session.

For a short introduction to this exciting option, check the [What is a flipped classroom](https://creately.com/blog/education/what-is-a-flipped-classroom/) post on Creately.

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDXkd2NyCCE&start_radio=1&list=RDnDXkd2NyCCE

Walter nació en Alemania en 1955. Aunque era un niño bastante guapo le costaba relacionarse con los demas debido a que tenía problemas de tartamudez a raíz de la separación de sus padres. 

"Casi no podía hablar. Me tomaba tres minutos completar una sola oración. Era algo abrumador para alguien que quería expresarse ante los demás y que quería ser escuchado pero que simplemente no podía. Era espantoso.".

Sin embargo a Walter (a quien todo el mundo conocía como "Bruno") amaba el blues, la música preferida de su padre. Quería cantar en su propia banda y para ello tenía que vencer su problema de comunicación así que se enfrentó directamente a él apuntándose a clases de teatro. Este es el resultado (play the music).

Claro que al final resultó que actuar estaba mejor pagado que la música, sobre todo cuando lo intentó en el cine y la televisión.
